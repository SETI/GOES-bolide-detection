,,,
Terms,,,Definition
Event Clusters ,,,"These are the groups of GLM data that are created by the first stage of the detection algorithm (""Clusters"" for short)."
Detection,,,"These are the subset of event clusters that the detection algorithm identifies as possible bolides (""Triggers"" for short)"
Bolide Candidate ,,,"the subset of detection that a person or machine has evaluated and promoted to the candidate stage (""Candidates"" for short)."
Confirmed Bolide,,,"The subset of candidate bolides that were also detected by another system, or otherwise confirmed beyond reasonable doubt (Maybe someday we’ll figure out a way to confirm them without an additional detection, but it seems prudent to start with a distinction until we formalize our process)(""Confirmed"" for short)"

ATAP Bolide Analysis,,,
These are the terms and quantities that show up on figures and in general discussions about the ATAP bolide analysis results.,,,

Terms,,,Definition
bolide analysis pipeline,,,The code performing follow-up analyses to detected bolide candidates.
L0,,,"The GLM Level-0 data product, transmitted directly from GOES."
L2,,,"The GLM Level-2 data product, delivered following ground processing of the L0 product."
pixel event,,,A GLM pixel measurement whose amplitude exceeds ~4𝜎 above the pixel's current background level.
impact event,,,The physical impact of an object with Earth's atmosphere.
detection,,,A set of groups in L2 data identified by the ATAP bolide detection pipeline.
detected event,,,A GLM pixel event whose assocaited group is included in one or more ATAP detections.
extracted event,,,"A GLM pixel event identified by the bolide analysis as belonging to the set of pixel events triggered by the hypothetical bolide. Typically, this will include most detected events and may include a significant number of additional pixel events."
active pixel,,,"Any pixel that recorded event during the specified time window is deemed ""active."""
maximum energy pixel,,,The pixel recording the most total energy of all active pixels. Typically the energy referred to will be the ATAP pixel impact energy defined below.
bounds,,,"The upper and lower bounds of a quantity. This may refer to hard bounds or the 3𝜎 confidence interval, depending on context."
