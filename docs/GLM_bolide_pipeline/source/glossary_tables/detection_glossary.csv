Terms,Definition

Clusters ,"The collection of GLM data groups that are created by the first clustering stage of the detection algorithm."

Confidence Score,"The Machine Learning classifier score identifying a cluster as a bolide."

Detection,"The subset of event clusters that the detection algorithm identifies as possible bolides, for example, above
a classifier confidence score threshold (""Triggers"" for short)"

Bolide Candidate ,"The subset of detections that a person or machine has evaluated and promoted to the candidate stage (""Candidates"" for short)."

Confirmed Bolide,"The subset of candidate bolides that were also detected by another system, or otherwise confirmed
beyond reasonable doubt (Maybe someday we’ll figure out a way to confirm them without an additional detection, but it
seems prudent to start with a distinction until we formalize our process)(""Confirmed"" for short)"
